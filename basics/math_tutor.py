# Math Tutor - Project
# Multiplication tables
# Object: Create application to practice multiplication tables
# - User specifies number of random practice questions
# - User is presented with a prompt e.g. 5 X 5 = and inputs the answer for each question
# - When all questions are answered, print out the following info:
#       a. Some form of 'thanks for playing' greeting
#       b. Number of correct answers / total answers
#       c. % correct
#   Use different rows as you wish.
#   Remember \n (line break) or '' doesnâ€™t work properly with Brython
# Bonus 1: Also measure / present the time it took to answer questions:
#          in total and per question
# Bonus 2: Show all questions and answers at the end
