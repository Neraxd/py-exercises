# üõÇ Access Control Scanner Challenge
#
# 1. Create a set of revoked badge numbers.
# 2. Create two empty lists: "approved" and "denied".
# 3. Start a loop to collect visitor info:
#    - Ask for the visitor's name (or type "done" to finish).
#    - If the name is "done", exit the loop.
#    - Otherwise, ask for their badge number.
#    - Check if the badge is revoked:
#        ‚Ä¢ If revoked: add the name to "denied" and display "ACCESS DENIED".
#        ‚Ä¢ If not: add the name to "approved" and display "ACCESS GRANTED".
# 4. Print the final "Access Summary" for "‚úÖ Approved Visitors" & "‚õîÔ∏è Denied Visitors":
#    - Sort both lists alphabetically.
#    - Display the total number of approved and denied visitors.
