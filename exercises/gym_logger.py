# ðŸ§  Exercise: Gym Workout Logger
#
# Goal:
# Write a function `log_workout()` that tracks a userâ€™s exercises and progress.
#
# The function should accept:
# - Positional arguments: user_name, day (e.g., "Monday")
# - Default arguments: duration=60 (minutes of workout)
# - Arbitrary positional arguments (*exercises) â€” list of exercises done
# - Arbitrary keyword arguments (**stats) â€” optional stats like calories_burned, heart_rate, notes
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Print the user name and day.
# 2. Print all exercises performed (from *exercises).
# 3. Print the duration of the workout.
# 4. If any stats are provided, print them in a neat format.
# 5. Return a summary string like:
#    "User: Ilia, Day: Monday, Exercises: 3, Duration: 60 min"
#
# ðŸ§ª Mini challenges:
# - Call it with no exercises and only defaults.
# - Call it with several exercises but no stats.
# - Call it with exercises and stats.
# - Try skipping duration using the default while passing stats.
